    \section{Guidelines}
    \subsection{Guidelines for the Prospective User/Assessor}
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
        \item A prospective user/assessor should read through any associated HSE documentation including, but not limited to, any Risk Assessments (RA) or Work Instructions (WI) associated with the equipment prior to assessment.
        \item A prospective user/assessor should request practical training prior to competency assessment.
        \item A competency to operate (CTO) certificate will expire in five years from the date of issue. It is up to the user/assessor to be re-certified after five years. If the user/assessor has consistently used the equipment over the past five years, a supervisor can deem the user/assessor competent without further assessment. If the equipment has not been consistently used a new assessment will need to be undertaken.
        \item The completed CTO shall be stored by the user and a copy sent to \textit{cto.ref@qut.edu.au}.
        \item Gaining competency in this equipment does not mean you automatically gain competency in and are allowed to operate similar pieces of equipment, unless specifically stated. A CTO must be gained in each piece of equipment.
    \end{itemize}
    \subsection{Guidelines for the Assessor}
    \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
        \item This assessment is to be completed after the prospective user/assessor has had a practical demonstration of the operation of the equipment.
        \item The prospective user/assessor may use the manufacturer's handbook, work instruction(s), QUT documentation, or other any other information source except for personnel, as an aid if reuqired.
        \item Assess the prospective user/assessor completing given tasks under normal working conditions.
        \item The prospective user/assessor must be signed off as competent in all sections (as instructed) before being deemed competent to operate the equipment covered by this assessment. Assessor's initials are required in each section.
        \item The prospective user/assessor must be notified of any area(s) where they are assessed as not yet competent. This will allow the prospective user/assessor to arrange for further training in this area.
